This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate plant disease classification based on leaf images. Built with a deep learning backend and deployed through a user-friendly Streamlit interface, it enables prediction of plant diseases to assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural experts. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images, aiming to provide early diagnosis and reduce crop loss.

âœ¨ Features:

ðŸ”¸Image upload interface for live prediction
ðŸ”¸Pretrained CNN model for high accuracy
ðŸ”¸Streamlit-based responsive web app
ðŸ”¸Modular and easy-to-extend code structure
